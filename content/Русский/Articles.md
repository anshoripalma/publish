Watching:

About halfway through Better Than Humans on Netflix, but most of my Russian watching has been Youtube. Varlamov being by far my favourite. Enormous amount super interesting content about travel/politics/history/problems in Russia today. This dude is constantly churning out high quality content, including regularly putting out two hour long mammoth videos. I know he has a team, but I still cannot imagine how many hours every day this guy puts into his work. He has to be the busiest guy on Youtube.

Comprehensible Russian Podcast with Max

Russian Progress

Как жить

Не перебивай!

От хора до хардкора (podcast about the history of various musical genres - the episode on German rap was a fascinating listen, just as I was getting into German rap!)

Что это было - BBC Russia news podcast

Что случилось - Meduza's main news podcast. Sometimes it gets very into the weeds on regional Russian politics and I zone out for an episode, but there's a new episode 5 times a week so a lot of stuff to listen to.

Говорят, что...

Пассажиры Юмей-Мару - great historical podcast about a group of children who were stranded in Siberia during the Russian Civil War and how they had to sail around the world to get back to St Petersburg.
